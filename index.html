              "Sonnie's Edge" is the first episode from animated anthology
               "Love, Death & Robots"the story features brutal death matches
                between bio-beasts that are controlled by humans They transfer
                 Sonnie’s mind and consciousness into a bio-beast by the name
                  Khanivore. Sonnie’s body is remotely controlled by her through
                   bioware processors spliced to the spine. So if the beast dies,
                    Sonnie dies, because that’s where her mind exists. Nobody but
                     the three of them knows of this fact.this story has a very
                      great plot it is mind blowing my personal opinion is that
                       this is the best episode for me in the whole first season.
                       The story begins with a rich match-fixer, Dicko, who approaches
                        the trio and offers $500,000 to lose the next battle. They refuse.
                         Sonnie (beast) is hurt bad in the duel but she beats her opponent,
                          Turboraptor.Dicko’s assistant Jennifer approaches to talk to Sonnie
                           after the match. Jennifer is actually a mutant of sorts, Dicko’s                           
                           “security”, and has come to kill Sonnie.Jennifer
                             seduces Sonnie and jabs her claws through her head. 
                             Dicko shows up to gloat and we’re finally shown that Sonnie 
                             is not in her body. She speaks via a speaker system. She kills 
                             Jennifer in an instant and grabs Dicko to finish him off. However, 
                             we are not given that visual treat of Dicko’s death. The short film 
                             ends with Sonnie asking Dicko “Do you feel it? (the fear, the edge)”
                              as he pleads for his life and the story ends.yet there are still other episodes
                              that will blow your mind its either scary,gory,adventure,futuristic,exciting all
                               throughout 3 seasons.if i convinced u enough to watch the series u can watch it for
